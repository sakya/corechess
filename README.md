## Supported engines

- UCI (Universal Chess Interface) like [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/), [Komodo](https://komodochess.com/) and [Leela Chess Zero](https://lczero.org/)

- CECP (Chess Engine Communication Protocol) like [Crafty](https://craftychess.com/)

- The King (Chessmaster). Supported only on Windows.

### The King (Chessmaster)

  To use The King (the Chessmaster engine) you need the file TheKing333.exe (Chessmaster 10), the "Personalities" folder and the "Opening Books" folder and patch the engine using the [OPK patch](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930221944/http://www.freewebs.com/jakent/) that disables the copy protection.

  You can then set the personalities path and opening books path in the engine settings.

## Supported opening book formats

- Polyglot (BIN)
- Arena opening book (ABK)
- Chessmaster (OBK)
