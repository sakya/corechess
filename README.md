# **CoreChess**

CoreChess is an open source chess GUI for chess engines

## Supported engines

- UCI (Universal Chess Interface) like [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) and [Komodo](https://komodochess.com/)

- CECP (Chess Engine Communication Protocol) like [Crafty](https://craftychess.com/)

- The King (Chessmaster)

### The King (Chessmaster)

  To use The King (the Chessmaster engine) you need the file TheKing333.exe (Chessmaster 10), the "Personalities" folder and the "Opening Books" folder and patch the engine using the [OPK patch](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930221944/http://www.freewebs.com/jakent/) that disables the copy protection.

  You can then set the personalities path and opening books path in the engine settings.

## Supported opening books format

- Polyglot (BIN)
- Arena opening book (ABK)
- Chessmaster (OBK)
